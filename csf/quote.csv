The gladdest moment in human life is a departure into unknown lands.
Be fearless in the pursuit of what sets your soul on fire.
Travel makes one modest. You see what a tiny place you occupy in the world
Better to see something once than hear about it a thousand times
Adventure may hurt you but monotony will kill you.
Don’t listen to what they say. Go see.
All you need to know is that it’s possible.
To Travel is to Live
The journey not the arrival matters.
Life is short and the world is wide
